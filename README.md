This repo contains the Ethical Assessment Tool for Conversational AI. The tool was developed by the Open Voice TrustMark Initiative to help assess whether the conversational AI products and services that is being developed, deployed, procured or used, complies with the six ethical principles of the TrustMark Initative, as specified in our Ethical Guidelines for Voice Experiences:

* Inclusivity
* Privacy
* Accountability
* Transparency
* Sustainability
* Governance/Compliance

The Ethical Assessment Tool aims to provide a process for self-evaluation to allow organizations to assess whether they adhere to the principles and core values of trustworthy conversational AI.
